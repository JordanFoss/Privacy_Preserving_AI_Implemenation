# Privacy Preserving AI Implemenation
This is my repo for my ENGG4812 thesis project. Pretty much the plan is to use this repo to store the code and keep a version history. This way I will have a good timeline of the work I did.

The python files Data_Functions.py and Generialised_Model_Code.py contain the code used for the testing conducted for this project. Data_Functions.py contains mostly functions for the handling of the dataset and Generialised_Model_Code.py contains functions used for the generation of figures used through the associated report.
