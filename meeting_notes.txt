6/9/2022 Meeting:
	- I need to implement Batch normalisation on my features as the noise affects some features more then others (normalise input features)
	- I should implement N fold cross validation, which pretty much makes many training and test sets then takes the average
	- I need to create a confusion matrix for each model to view the results

9/8/2022 Meeting:
	Questions:
	- How deeply should I explore how DP interferes with possible attack vectors?
		- Yep this should be done
	- H & S assessment for proposal?
		- Talk about possible speed bumps in the project
	- Uncertainity in plan?
		- Try to be realisatic
